# Weather App Built with React Native Expo

## Key Points:

### 1. Two Themes:
- The app offers two distinct themes for different weather conditions - one for sunny weather and another for bad weather. This enhances user experience by providing visual cues corresponding to the current weather.

### 2. Data Caching with Redux Persist:
- Utilizing Redux Persist, the app caches weather data to ensure seamless user experience even in offline scenarios. This feature enhances performance and reduces the reliance on network connectivity.

### 3. Custom Hook for Location Retrieval:
- A custom hook is implemented to fetch longitude and latitude coordinates, with proper error handling in case access to location services is not granted. This ensures smooth functioning of location-based features while maintaining user privacy.

### 4. Custom Hook for API Calls:
- Another custom hook is employed for making API calls to retrieve weather data. This abstraction simplifies code maintenance and promotes reusability across the application.

### 5. TypeScript Integration:
- The project is built with TypeScript, adhering to best practices for type safety and improved code maintainability. TypeScript helps catch potential errors during development and enhances the overall robustness of the codebase.

### 6. Temperature Unit Conversion:
- The app provides the option to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature units, catering to the preferences of diverse user bases.
